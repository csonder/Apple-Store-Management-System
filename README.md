## Code Structure

- **Launch.java**: Entry point of the application.
- **Login.java**: Handles user authentication and main menu navigation.
- **Admin.java**: Stores admin credentials.
- **AdminMenu.java**: Admin dashboard for managing products, customers, and transactions.
- **Customer.java**: Manages customer data and registration.
- **CustomerMenu.java**: Customer dashboard for browsing, purchasing, and viewing transactions.
- **Display.java**: Responsible for displaying menus and titles.
- **ManageProducts.java**: Product management panel for Admin.

## How It Works

1. The application starts and prompts the user to login as Admin or Customer.
2. Admins can add/delete/view products, view customers, and view all transactions.
3. Customers can sign up, login, browse products, make purchases, and view their own transaction history.
4. Purchases update product stock and save transactions.
5. Payment options include cash (with change calculation) and credit card (basic validation).
6. Receipts are printed after successful payment.
7. Users can logout to return to the login menu or exit the program.

## Limitations

- Data is stored in-memory using static arrays; no persistent database.
- Basic validation for inputs; no encryption for passwords.
- Limited error handling.
- Console-based UI using `Scanner` and `JOptionPane`.

---

## Future Improvements

- Add persistent storage (database integration).
- Encrypt passwords for security.
- Enhance UI with a graphical interface.
- Add more detailed payment validation.
- Implement product categories and search.
- Include reporting and analytics features.
